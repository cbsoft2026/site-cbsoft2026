#### Call for Papers

In 2026, SBCARS marks its 20th edition, reaffirming its role as the premier Brazilian venue for research, innovation, and practice in software components, architectures, and reuse. We invite researchers, practitioners, and industry professionals to submit their original research to the [20th Brazilian Symposium on Components, Architectures, and Software Reuse](https://cbsoft.sbc.org.br/2026/en/symposiums/sbcars/)! This year, SBCARS will be held in São Paulo.

#### Scope

SBCARS serves as a forum for discussing current challenges and emerging opportunities in designing, developing, evolving, and reusing software at scale. As systems continue to grow in complexity, SBCARS provides a unique space to explore foundational advances and real-world experiences shaping the future of software architecture and reuse.

We welcome submissions on a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

* Agile Software Architecture and Design
* AI-Assisted Software Design, Architecture, and Reuse
* API Development and Evolution
* Component-Based Software Engineering
* Design Patterns
* Domain Analysis and Engineering
* Generative Programming and Domain-Specific Languages
* Model-Driven Engineering
* Program Repair
* Program Transformation and Refactoring
* Reuse and Variability in Open-Source Software
* Service-Orientation and Microservices
* Sociotechnical Aspects in Software Design, Architecture, and Reuse
* Software Analysis, Comprehension, and Reconstruction
* Software Architecture
* Software Product Lines
* Software Maintenance, Reengineering, and Evolution
* Software Metrics for Design, Architecture, and Reuse
* Software Modularity
* Software Repository Mining
* Software Reuse 
* Software Sustainability
* Software Visualization
* Variability Management

#### Types of Submissions

SBCARS 2026 welcomes the following types of papers: 

*Technical Research Papers:* We invite high-quality, original, and unpublished research contributions presenting novel ideas, methods, tools, empirical studies, surveys, and theoretical advances related to components, architectures, and software reuse. Page limit: up to 10 pages (+2 for references).


*Data Papers:* We welcome submissions centered on datasets, benchmarks, curated repositories, and data resources of interest to the SBCARS community. Submissions should describe the context, creation process, structure, limitations, and potential reuse of the data. Page limit: up to 4 pages (+2 for references). Authors of accepted Data Papers must make their artifacts publicly accessible. Recommended data repositories include: [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) and [Figshare](https://figshare.com/). GitHub is not a proper data repository.


#### Reviewing Process

Papers meeting all the submission requirements will be reviewed by at least three Program Committee members, according to the following criteria:

* **Originality:** Novelty and innovation of the paper in relation to the state of the art, including proposed approaches, solutions, problem formulations, methodologies, theories, or evaluations.
* **Relevance:** Importance of the paper’s contributions to the Software Engineering field.
* **Rigor:** Soundness, clarity, and depth of a technical or theoretical contribution, as well as the level of detail and completeness of the method and evaluation.
* **Verifiability and Transparency:** The extent to which the paper provides sufficient information to assess and reproduce the methods, data, analyses, and results presented, including the adequacy and completeness of research artifacts, when provided.
* **Presentation:** Quality of the paper’s writing, including clear descriptions, grammatical correctness, absence of ambiguities, legibility of figures and tables, and compliance with formatting instructions.

We encourage authors to make their artifacts open and accessible, although it is not mandatory.

#### On the use of AI (Artificial Intelligence) or AI-assisted technologies in Research Papers

By submitting papers to SBES 2026, authors acknowledge compliance with the generative AI usage policy, based on existing policies proposed by IEEE, ACM, and Springer.

It is prohibited to:

* List generative AI tools and technologies (such as ChatGPT) as authors of papers.
* Use articles or sections entirely produced by generative AI tools.

It is allowed to -- with explicit mention in the acknowledgments:

* Use generative AI tools to create parts of the content, with a disclosure in the acknowledgments indicating what was generated and which tool was used. Authors must check the tool’s terms of use. Example: "ChatGPT was used to generate the first paragraph of Section 3 and Table 3.2."

It is allowed to -- without mention in the paper:

* Use AI or AI-assisted technologies to improve image quality (contrast and clarity); and
* Use generative AI tools to edit and improve the quality of existing text (similarly to grammar assistants such as Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, and engagement).

#### Anonymization

The SBCARS 2026 Research Track adopts a double-anonymous review process. All submitted papers should conceal the identity of the authors. Both author names and affiliations must be omitted. In addition, the following rules should be addressed:

* Citations to own related work must be written in the third person. For example, one must write "the previous work of Silva et al." as opposed to "our previous work." Terms that can identify the authors, such as "we", "our", "ours", "GitHub", and "funding", must be avoided and should be removed before submission.
*  Papers should not mention any artifact in repositories or websites that can identify the authorship. If any artifact needs to be made available, it should be anonymized in the repository/website. For using GitHub, we recommend the "anonymous" service (https://anonymous.4open.science/);
* If the submitted paper is a follow-up of a previous work, the reference may be anonymized in the submitted paper. For example, "the previous work of Silva et al." can be adapted to "based on the previous work [Ref]" and the reference at the end of the paper can be presented as "[Ref] Anonymous authors. Omitted due to double-blind review.";
* Reviewers will not be encouraged to search for references in other online sources that identify the authors. Searches in digital libraries or existing artifacts do not break the double-anonymous policy.

After paper acceptance, all the paper information (without anonymization) must be included in the camera-ready version. Any questions regarding paper preparation in accordance with the double-blind rules can be directed to the Program Committee Chairs.

Any questions about paper preparation following the double-anonymous rules can be sent to the Program Committee Chairs.

#### Desk Rejection

Submissions that fall outside the scope of the SBCARS 2026 Research Track or do not comply with the required format and anonymization rules will be rejected without review.

If a previous publication of the paper, or a simultaneous submission to a refereed venue (event or journal), is identified, the paper will be rejected at any time, and authors may be prevented from submitting papers in future SBCARS editions. Additionally, the organizers of the other venue will be informed about the fact.

If evidence is found that generative AI tools were used in the submission in ways that do not comply with the guidelines for the use of generative AI in this call, the paper will be rejected without review, and the authors may be prevented from submitting papers in future SBCARS editions.

#### Artifact Evaluation

Authors of accepted papers (Technical, Industrial, or Data Papers) will be invited to submit research artifacts to an optional Artifact Evaluation track. Artifacts will be assessed for availability, completeness, documentation, and reproducibility.

#### Submission Guidelines

* All submissions must be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) format.
* All submissions must be written in Portuguese or English and, temporarily, must adhere to the ACM two-column format (ACM_SigConf), available at this [link](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). The final format will be available soon.
* Submit your papers electronically through [JEMS3](https://jems3.sbc.org.br/events/452).

Accepted papers will be published in the SBCARS 2026 proceedings. At least one author is expected to attend the conference and present the accepted paper. More details on submission guidelines, paper formatting, and the technical program committee are  available at: https://cbsoft.sbc.org.br/2026/en/symposiums/sbcars

We look forward to receiving your valuable contributions and to welcoming you to São Paulo for SBCARS 2026!
