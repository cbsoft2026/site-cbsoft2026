The Brazilian Symposium on Software Components, Architectures, and Reuse (SBCARS) is promoted by the Brazilian Computer Society (SBC) and brings together researchers, students, and professionals with a wide range of interests in topics related to Software Engineering, including software product lines, component-based software development, software architecture, and software reuse. Started in 2007, SBCARS is the successor to the series of six Brazilian Workshops on Component-Based Development (WDBC), started in 2001, so its 19 editions already held have contributed to its consolidation in the national scientific calendar as an important technical-scientific event in the software area.
