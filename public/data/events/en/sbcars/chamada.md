#### Call for Papers

In 2026, SBCARS marks its 20th edition, reaffirming its role as the premier Brazilian venue for research, innovation, and practice in software components, architectures, and reuse. We invite researchers, practitioners, and industry professionals to submit their original research to the [20th Brazilian Symposium on Components, Architectures, and Software Reuse](https://cbsoft.sbc.org.br/2026/en/symposiums/sbcars/)! This year, SBCARS will be held in São Paulo.

#### Scope

SBCARS serves as a forum for discussing current challenges and emerging opportunities in designing, developing, evolving, and reusing software at scale. As systems continue to grow in complexity, SBCARS provides a unique space to explore foundational advances and real-world experiences shaping the future of software architecture and reuse.

We welcome submissions on a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

* Agile Software Architecture and Design
* AI-Assisted Software Design, Architecture, and Reuse
* API Development and Evolution
* Component-Based Software Engineering
* Design Patterns
* Domain Analysis and Engineering
* Generative Programming and Domain-Specific Languages
* Model-Driven Engineering
* Program Repair
* Program Transformation and Refactoring
* Reuse and Variability in Open-Source Software
* Service-Orientation and Microservices
* Sociotechnical Aspects in Software Design, Architecture, and Reuse
* Software Analysis, Comprehension, and Reconstruction
* Software Architecture
* Software Product Lines
* Software Maintenance, Reengineering, and Evolution
* Software Metrics for Design, Architecture, and Reuse
* Software Modularity
* Software Repository Mining
* Software Reuse 
* Software Sustainability
* Software Visualization
* Variability Management

#### Types of Submissions

SBCARS 2026 welcomes the following types of papers: 

*Technical Research Papers:* We invite high-quality, original, and unpublished research contributions presenting novel ideas, methods, tools, empirical studies, surveys, and theoretical advances related to components, architectures, and software reuse. Page limit: up to 10 pages (+2 for references).


*Data Papers:* We welcome submissions centered on datasets, benchmarks, curated repositories, and data resources of interest to the SBCARS community. Submissions should describe the context, creation process, structure, limitations, and potential reuse of the data. Page limit: up to 4 pages (+2 for references). Authors of accepted Data Papers must make their artifacts publicly accessible. Recommended data repositories include: [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) and [Figshare](https://figshare.com/). GitHub is not a proper data repository.


#### Reviewing Process

Evaluation criteria include rigor, novelty, relevance, presentation, verifiability/transparency, and openness for replication. We encourage authors to make their artifacts open and accessible, although it is not mandatory.

All submissions will undergo a rigorous double-blind peer review process. The papers submitted must not reveal the authors' identities in any way.

* Authors should leave out their names and affiliations from the body of their submission.
* Authors should ensure that any citation to related work by themselves is written in the third person, that is, "the prior work of XYZ" as opposed to "our prior work".
* Authors should avoid providing URLs to author-revealing sites (e.g., tools or datasets). Any supplemental sites should be fully anonymized. While open science is encouraged for all authors, visiting such sites should not be necessary to conduct reviews.
* Authors should anonymize author-revealing company names, while still providing general characteristics of the organizations involved to help readers understand the paper's context.

For fairness, all submitted papers must comply with the above instructions. Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review at the discretion of the PC chairs.

#### Artifact Evaluation

Authors of accepted papers (Technical, Industrial, or Data Papers) will be invited to submit research artifacts to an optional Artifact Evaluation track. Artifacts will be assessed for availability, completeness, documentation, and reproducibility.

#### Submission Guidelines

* All submissions must be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) format.
* All submissions must be written in Portuguese or English and must adhere to the ACM two-column format (ACM_SigConf), available at this [link](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). 
* Submit your papers electronically through [JEMS3](https://jems3.sbc.org.br/events/452).

Accepted papers will be published in the SBCARS 2026 proceedings. At least one author is expected to attend the conference and present the accepted paper. More details on submission guidelines, paper formatting, and the technical program committee are  available at: https://cbsoft.sbc.org.br/2026/en/symposiums/sbcars

We look forward to receiving your valuable contributions and to welcoming you to São Paulo for SBCARS 2026!
