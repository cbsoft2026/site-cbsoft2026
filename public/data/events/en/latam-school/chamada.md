The main goal of the LATAM SE School is to help new and prospective Software Engineering (SE) researchers become part of the broader software engineering community. The school will allow participants to explore potential research paths and gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities in SE research. Students will have an excellent opportunity to interact with leading academic and industry researchers, learn about their careers, discover how to disseminate research results, and hear about important topics that are not typically covered in graduate courses.
