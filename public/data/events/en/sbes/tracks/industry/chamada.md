#### Overview

The **Industry Track** of the Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (**CBSoft 2026**) aims to foster cooperation among academia, the indrustry, and the government through talks, articles, and discussions. Its goal is to bring together professionals from all three sectors to share their knowledge and experiences with the community.

This is an excellent opportunity to establish cooperative relationships between the academic and professional communities. It is also a venue for establishing applied research partnerships, fostering market development, and promoting innovation through technology transfer.

#### Call for Presentations (Industry Talks)

The track invites submissions from academics and practitioners from the productive sector (public or private organizations) who wish to share theoretical and technological knowledge and jointly identify opportunities for developing collaborative networks and research at the intersection of academia and industry.

We welcome proposals for presentations on practical experiences regarding the development of platforms, systems, tools, applications, and open-source products. Proposals should describe market challenges (open problems) and solutions applicable to the industry.

**Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:**

* **Empirical/Experimental Software Engineering:** Applications or usage of tools, different software processes/practices, and their impact on the organization.
Internal Tools: Architectural and usability decisions regarding internal tools, and their impact on team productivity and application resilience.
* **Testing & Resilience:** Practices, processes, and tools related to software testing and resilience.
* **AI & SE:** Software Engineering for Artificial Intelligence and Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineering.
* **Multi-cloud:** Architectures for multi-cloud systems.
* **Security:** Secure Software Engineering.
* **Sustainability:** Green software engineering and energy optimization.
* **Collaboration Models:** Reflections on academia-industry interaction, models, methods, and lessons learned.
