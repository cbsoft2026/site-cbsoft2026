Software testing is of central importance to verify and validate software systems. Moreover, empirical studies show that test-related activities often account for over 50% of software development costs. Systematic and automated approaches have shown capable of reducing this overwhelming cost. Industrial success cases have been openly reported, and academic interest continues to grow as observed by the growing number of researchers in the field.

The primary goal of SAST is building a forum that brings the research and industry communities together to discuss improvements in software testing systematization and automation regarding different categories of software systems.
