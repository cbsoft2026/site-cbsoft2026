CBSoft 2026 will consolidate the evaluation of artifacts and the assignment of Artifact Badges. As in 2025, the PDFs of papers with successfully evaluated artifacts will receive badges for publication as an official part of CBSoft. The goal of the Artifact Festival is to

1. promote Open Science in Software Engineering research,

2. reward authors of papers who share their artifacts, and

3. help readers identify papers with available and functional artifacts.

Papers with badges contain reusable artifacts, promoting transparency and enabling other researchers to replicate the study, validate its findings, and advance their own research through reuse. Papers with badges also enjoy greater prestige within the scientific community. Authors of papers accepted in SBES (any track), SBLP, SBCARS, and SAST may submit artifacts associated with those papers for evaluation.
