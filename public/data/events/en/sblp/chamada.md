## About

SBLP 2025 is the 29th edition of the Brazilian Symposium on Programming Languages. It is promoted by the Brazilian Computer Society (SBC) and constitutes a forum for researchers, students, and professionals to present and discuss ideas and innovations in the design, definition, analysis, implementation, and practical use of programming languages. SBLP's first edition was in 1996 and since 2010 it has been part of CBSoft, the Brazilian Conference on Software: Theory and Practice.

The Conference will be held from 22 to 26 September, 2025, in Recife, Pernambuco

## Topics of Interest

- Programming paradigms and styles, scripting and domain-specific languages, and support for real-time, service-oriented, multi-threaded, parallel, distributed, and quantum programming
- Program generation and transformation
- Formal semantics and theoretical foundations: denotational, operational, algebraic, and categorical
- Program analysis and verification, type systems, static analysis, and abstract interpretation
- Programming language design and implementation, programming, language environments, compilation and interpretation techniques
- Programming languages for the blockchain technology: design and implementation of Smart Contract languages, implementation of consensus protocols, language-based security, and cryptographic primitives
- Other topics related to programming languages, in addition to those listed above.

## Important dates

## Submission Guidelines

Papers may be written in Portuguese or English. Submissions in English are encouraged. Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings, indexed by [SBC-OpenLib (SOL)](https://sol.sbc.org.br/index.php/indice). There are two categories for submissions:

- Full papers: up to 8 pages (not including references).
- Short papers: up to 3 pages (not including references).

Short papers can discuss ideas at an early stage of development or partial results of ongoing dissertations or theses. We invite graduate and undergraduate students seeking feedback to submit short papers of their original unpublished and in-progress research work.

SBLP 2025 will use a lightweight double-blind review process. Manuscripts must be submitted anonymously, without listing the authors’ names. References to your own work should be in the third person. Please submit papers in PDF format, through [JEMS (Journal and Event Management System)](https://jems3.sbc.org.br/sblp2025). Use 10pt, two-column, [ACM conference format](http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template):

```latex
\\documentclass[10pt,sigplan,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}
\\setcopyright{none}
\\settopmatter{printacmref=false}
\\renewcommand\\footnotetextcopyrightpermission[1]{}
```

Papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. At least one author of each accepted paper must register and present the paper in the symposium. A no-show will result in the paper being removed from the proceedings.

## Awards

Three best paper awards will be attributed to the full paper submissions.

## Special Issue Publication

A selection of the best papers appearing in the last editions of SBLP has been invited to be extended and considered for publication in a special issue of the Journal of Computer Languages (COLA), by Elsevier. We will approach COLA for a similar special issue regarding the SBLP 2025.
