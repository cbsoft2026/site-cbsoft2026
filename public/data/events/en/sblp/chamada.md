The SBLP 2026 will be the 30th edition of the Brazilian Symposium on Programming Languages. It is organized by the Brazilian Computer Society (SBC) and serves as a forum for students, researchers, and professionals to present and discuss ideas and innovations in the design, definition, analysis, implementation, and practical use of programming languages. The first edition of SBLP took place in 1996, and since 2010, the symposium has been part of CBSoft, the Brazilian Congress on Software: Theory and Practice.
