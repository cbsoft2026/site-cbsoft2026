SBLP 2026 is the 30th edition of the Brazilian Symposium on Programming Languages. Organized by the Brazilian Computer Society (SBC), SBLP is a well-established forum for researchers, students, and professionals interested in all aspects of programming languages, ranging from theoretical foundations to practical applications. The symposium brings together the programming languages communities to present and discuss advances in language design, semantics, analysis, implementation techniques, and tools that support the development of reliable, secure, and efficient software systems, fostering collaboration, the exchange of ideas, and the dissemination of high-quality research results.    

#### Topics
    
* Programming Paradigms and Styles
* Scripting and Domain-Specific Languages
* Concurrent, Parallel, Distributed, and Quantum Programming
* Program Generation and Transformation
* Formal Semantics and Theoretical Foundations
* Program Analysis and Verification
* Language Design, Implementation, and Environments
* Blockchain and Smart Contract Languages
* Language-based Security and Cryptographic Mechanisms
* Additional Topics in Programming Languages

#### Tracks

SBLP 2026 welcomes submissions to two complementary tracks, addressing different stages of the research career while maintaining the same scientific standards.

<strong>Main Track.</strong> Intended for submissions authored by graduate students, researchers, and professionals. This track welcomes original research contributions, including new theoretical results, innovative language designs, empirical studies, experience reports, and case studies demonstrating the impact of programming-language technologies in practice.
    
<strong>Undergraduate Track.</strong> Intended for undergraduate students who are beginning their research careers. This track focuses on studies developed within undergraduate research activities, such as projects conducted in research groups, final course projects, or similar academic initiatives. Submissions are evaluated with particular attention to the potential of the ideas and the clarity of presentation, taking into account the authors’ level of experience.
    
Both tracks accept submissions as either <strong>full papers</strong> or <strong>short papers</strong>:
    
* <strong>Full papers:</strong> up to 8 pages (excluding references). Full papers should present mature, completed research, including a clear statement of the problem, solid methodology, thorough experimental or theoretical evaluation, and well-supported conclusions.
        
* <strong>Short papers:</strong> up to 4 pages (excluding references). Short papers may report early-stage ideas, preliminary results, negative or inconclusive findings with useful lessons, or partial outcomes from ongoing projects, dissertations, or theses.

Authors from both the Main Track and the Undergraduate Track may choose the most appropriate format (full or short) according to the maturity and scope of their work. All submissions must be in PDF, formatted according to the conference template, and submitted through [JEMS](https://jems3.sbc.org.br/).        

#### Review Process and Submission Policy

Papers may be written in Portuguese or English, and submissions in English are especially encouraged.

SBLP 2026 will use a lightweight <strong>double-blind review</strong> process. This means that reviewers will not know the identity of the authors, and authors will not be informed of the identity of individual reviewers. The goal is to reduce bias related to authors’ affiliation, seniority, or prior reputation and to focus the evaluation on the quality and originality of the work itself.
    
Manuscripts must therefore be submitted <strong>anonymously</strong>: the authors’ names, affiliations, acknowledgments, and any other personally identifying information must be removed from the PDF. References to your own previous work should be written in the third person, as if by unrelated authors, and should not reveal the authors’ identity. When in doubt about how to anonymize specific material (such as supplementary artifacts or online repositories), authors should err on the side of preserving anonymity and may provide anonymized links or clearly state that additional material will be made available after acceptance.

Papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. Submissions that substantially extend previously published work must clearly state and justify the differences. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the symposium and present the paper. A no-show will result in the paper being removed from the proceedings.
    
#### Publication, Indexing, and Awards

All accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings, indexed by SBC-OpenLib (SOL), ensuring wide visibility and long-term accessibility for the contributions presented at SBLP 2026.
    
A selection of the best papers from recent editions of SBLP has been invited to be extended and considered for publication in a special issue of the <em>Journal of Computer Languages (COLA)</em>, published by Elsevier. For SBLP 2026, the organizers plan to approach COLA for a similar special issue, inviting authors of the most highly ranked and promising papers to submit extended versions of their work for further peer review. Such extensions typically require a significant addition of new material, deeper evaluation, and a broader discussion of the results.
    
To recognize outstanding contributions, **four best paper awards** will be granted: two among the full paper submissions in the Main Track and **two** among the full paper submissions in the Undergraduate Track. The selection will consider scientific quality, originality, clarity of presentation, and potential impact on the programming languages community. Awarded papers will be highlighted during the symposium and in the conference publicity, and the authors will receive a formal certificate.
