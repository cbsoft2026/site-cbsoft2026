## Call for Papers

Software testing is of central importance to verify and validate software systems. Moreover, empirical studies show that test-related activities often account for over 50% of software development costs. Systematic and automated approaches have shown capable of reducing this overwhelming cost. Industrial success cases have been openly reported, and academic interest continues to grow as observed by the growing number of researchers in the field.

The primary goal of SAST is building a forum that brings the research and industry communities together to discuss improvements in software testing systematization and automation regarding different categories of software systems.

In its tenth edition as a symposium co-located with the Brazilian Congress of Software: Theory and Practice (CBSOFT), SAST 2025 invites the entire software testing community to submit results of their innovations in the field. This ninth edition of the symposium places special emphasis on fostering dialogue between industry and academia by encouraging industrial participation. As a result, in addition to research papers, this year we also have Industrial Abstracts. For this type of submission, test practitioners are invited to submit papers that focus on the pragmatic difficulties associated with carrying out software testing related activities in industry.

## Topics of Interest

SAST focuses on bringing together researchers and practitioners that have been working on systematic and automated practices, activities, and tools of software testing. The topics covered by the symposium include, but are not limited to, the following:

- AI-Assisted Software Testing
- Automated software testing: environments, tools, and industrial report on testing automation
- Combinatorial testing and random testing
- Distributed and parallel software testing
- Error-based and fault-based testing
- Management and integration of testing activities and resources
- Maintenance and reuse of test artifacts
- Model-based and model-driven testing
- Performance, load, and stress testing
- Prediction and Risk-based testing
- Program-based, specification-based, and requirements testing
- Test adequacy and coverage measurement
- Test case generation and selection techniques
- Test driver, stubs, harness, and test script generation
- Test effective analysis and test report generation
- Test oracle and test result checking techniques
- Testing of contemporary software systems: mobile, Cloud Computing, context-awareness, Internet of Things, Industry 4.0, Big Data
- Testing of learning-based software, including Deep Learning
- Testing of non-functional requirements: security, safety, interoperability, etc.

## Submission Guidelines

SAST accepts _two_ types of submissions:

- Regular Papers (no less than 6 pages and no longer than 10 pages, including all figures, references, and appendices); and
- Industrial Abstracts (should not exceed 3 pages for all materials).

All submissions should present original contributions to the software testing research area. Submissions should use the ACM 2-column format (_ACM_SigConf_) available at this [link](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). LaTeX users must use the acmart.cls class provided in the template with the conference format enabled at the document preamble:

`\documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}</code>`

Authors must use the ACM-Reference-Format.bst bibliography style also provided in the template:

`\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}`

Regular papers and industrial abstracts can be written either in Portuguese or in English. Submissions must be made in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) using the JEMS system ([https://jems3.sbc.org.br/sast2025](https://jems3.sbc.org.br/sast2025)).

Regular papers will go through a double-anonymous review process. Therefore, the initial paper submissions must not have any author identification. All information about authors and their institutions must be removed from the paper. Moreover, references to previous work must be anonymoused. For example, in in-text citations, we recommend using "[Anonymous 2025]" and "[Anonymous 2025] Information omitted for double-anonymous reviewing" in the reference list. After paper acceptance, all omitted information can be included in the camera-ready version.

Regular papers will be judged according to their adequacy to SAST scope, relevance, technical soundness, and originality. Regular papers should state their relation to previouswork, mainly to the previously published work of their authors. Papers on empirical studies should describe the used methods and interpret qualitatively and quantitatively their results. At least three Program Committee members will review all submissions.

All Industrial Abstract papers will go through a single-anonymous peer-review process: we will make an effort to include at least one industry expert among the reviewers. At least one of the authors must have a non-academic affiliation. Ideally, the author presenting the paper at the conference will be one with non-academic affiliations. We encourage contributions focusing on industrial innovation or lessons learned that can inspire future academic work. We also welcome submissions that are still in the early stages of development or works-in-progress, as well as experimentation that could lead to fresh perspectives and new ideas. The aim of this track is to promote the exchange of knowledge and experiences between academics and practitioners.

The publication of the accepted papers implies that at least one of its authors will register at CBSoft 2025 and will present the paper during SAST 2025.

## On use of AI (Artificial Intelligence) or AI-assisted technologies in research papers

When submitting to SAST 2025, the authors acknowledge that they comply with the Generative AI usage policy, based on existing policies proposed by IEEE, ACM, and Springer.

It is forbidden to:

- List Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, as authors of works
- Use texts or sections entirely produced by generative AI tools

It is allowed (with explicit disclosure in the acknowledgements) to:

- Use generative AI tools to create parts of the content, with disclosure in the paper acknowledgements indicating what was generated and which tool was used. It is important to check the terms of use of the tool, which is the responsibility of the authors. For example, in the acknowledgments: ChatGPT was used to generate the first paragraph of Section 3 and to generate Table 3.2.

It is allowed (no need to mention):

- Use AI or AI-assisted technologies to improve the quality of images in terms of contrast and clarity.
- Utilize generative AI tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text (similar to an assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement).
