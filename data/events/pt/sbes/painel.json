    "title": "Panel: Navigating AI's Impact on Software Quality and Production",
    "abstract": "As AI-powered tools, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), aggressively integrate into software development, they promise unprecedented boosts in productivity. However, this rapid adoption introduces a complex array of challenges to traditional software quality assurance and engineering practices. While LLMs excel at generating code snippets, they often struggle with architectural coherence, introduce subtle bugs, and can exacerbate technical debt by enabling individuals with less formal software engineering education to contribute code. <p>This panel will explore the multifaceted implications of AI-assisted software production on code quality, system architecture, team dynamics, and CS education. Our distinguished panelists will delve into critical questions facing software engineering today: how to assure the quality of future software systems in an AI-dominated SE environment? How can humans be kept in control of what is produced? How should we educate the new generation of software engineers?<p>Join us to discuss with a team of leading scientists in the field of software engineering some of the critical challenges of the field, including:<p><ul><li>The shifting landscape of software quality assurance</li><li>Architectural integrity and technical debt management</li><li>Human-AI collaboration and developer skills</li><li>Future of software engineering education and practices</li></ul>",
